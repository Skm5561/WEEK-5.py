📝 Description

This mini-project combines two essential Python skills: file handling and error management. You'll create a Python program that:

🖋️ Reads content from a file, modifies it (like removing unwanted lines or formatting the text), and writes the new version to a separate file.

🧪 Handles common errors gracefully, such as missing files or read/write issues, using try-except blocks.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this challenge, you’ll be able to:

Confidently read from and write to files in Python

Implement try, except, and handle common file-related exceptions

Build clean, reliable programs that don’t crash when things go wrong

This challenge is perfect for practicing real-world Python skills used in everything from data processing to automation and software development.
